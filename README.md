# Car Wash Management System

This repository contains the final project for my high school:
A Car Wash Management System developed in C# and SQL.
The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and uses Windows Forms for the user interface, along with the Bunifu UI framework to enhance the visual appearance.

## Features

The system has the following main features:

**Cars**: Allows adding, reading, updating, and deleting information about the cars that undergo washing at the facility.

**Customers**: Allows managing data of customers and link they to cars.

**Wash appointments**: Facilitates the scheduling and management of wash appointment to ensure efficient flow.

**Users**: Provides functions to manage system users, their roles, and permissions.

## To-Do

Although the project is functional, there are areas that can be improved:

- Implement a permissions system to restrict access to certain functions only to administrators.
- Make improvements to the user interface for a more intuitive and appealing experience.
- The buttons could be modified to be centered and uniform, but in the exam, the frontend wasn't evaluated, so I did it as quickly as possible.
